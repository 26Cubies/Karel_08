Karel_07
======

Karel starter code and resources for the Lab07 assignment.

Instructions:
* Use the FORK button to create a copy of this code under your personal Github account
* Clone that copy from your personal Github account onto your computer
* Read and consider the preparatory material in the document "fcpsKarel.doc" on page One-26 for background information on "polymorphism"
* Read the specification at the bottom of One-26.  Load Mountain.java and study the explore method.  Use this file to answer the questions on page One-27.
* Implement the classes HillClimber.java and StepClimber.java -- if you are confused as to what these should do, consult the API for more information.  Since both of these classes extend "Climber", your call to 'super' must match the formal arguments specified in the "Climber" constructor.
* Load Lab07.java and run, according to the directions at the bottom of One-26.
* Verify by reading that you understand the information presented on page One-28 regarding polymorphism and inheritance.
* Once you have finished working, commit your changes to your computer
* Push the code from your local computer up to your personal Github account
* Initiate a "Pull Request" from your completed project.  This will let me know that you are ready for me to evaluate your work.
